# AfterIDE

**A real-time, browser-based IDE built for rapid Python prototyping and terminal-first workflows.**

AfterIDE brings the power of a full development environment to the web. Designed for AI researchers, data engineers, and technical teams, it features:

* A real-time code editor powered by Monaco
* A fully interactive terminal with support for native commands like `python script.py`, `pip install`, `ls`, and `cat`
* Secure sandboxed execution of Python 3.11+ with support for scientific libraries like `pandas` and `scipy`
* Live output streaming that mirrors a local shell environment
* Code persistence with session tracking via SQL
* (Bonus) A built-in code review workflow: users can submit code, and reviewers can approve or reject with feedback

AfterIDE is part of AfterQuery’s vision to enable high-quality human data generation through powerful, domain-specific tooling. It gives technical experts and annotators an IDE-grade experience directly in the browser—accelerating dataset creation, debugging, and evaluation workflows.
